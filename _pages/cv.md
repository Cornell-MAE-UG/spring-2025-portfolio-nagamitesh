#### Work Experience
- **[MIT Lincoln Laboratory] - Summer Research Program Intern**  
  [May, 2025] - [August, 2025]  
  - Developed a rapidly-deployable low-cost airborne RF payload for use with radar systems, and designed payload to be adaptable and expandable for future applications using a Raspberry Pi and mainly commercial-off-the-shelf parts  
  - Engineered payload through thermal calculations, power budgets, and trade studies, along with defining system block diagrams, part selections, system integrations, and overall mechanical and electrical design  
  - Worked with GPS Disciplined Oscillators, Software Defined Radio, timing sources, radar systems, and Can-tenna radar
  - Pitched and created a novel drone-based crowd crush detection concept and worked with small intern team to present it to laboratory stake-holders and director as as part of the Intern Innovation Challenge

- **[Cornell Rocketry Team] - Structures Lead**  
  [June, 2025] - [Present, -]  
  - Leading development of novel composites airframes, air brake mechanisms, and avionics bay integration, along with rocket build, manufacturing, and composites planning  
  - Owning launch vehicle including system architecture, OpenRocket Simulations, CAD Model, and full integration
  
- **[BAE Systems Inc.] - Technical Intern II**  
  [May, 2024] - [August, 2024]  
  - Developed solutions to pressing near miss safety concerns utilizing Thermoplastic Polyurethane and 3D printing for flexiblity and durability, these were published as Better Practices to allow adoption across BAE sites nationwide
  - Learned about Continuous Improvement, Lean Manufacturing/Methodologies, Six Sigma, and 5S strategies
  - Explored ways to improve 3D design workflows using parametric modeling that resulted in a decrease of part workflow time from 2 hours to 15 minutes and reduced failed parts; also reverse-engineered deprecated components
  - Performed maintenance and fixes on 3D printers in the South Nashua 3D Printing lab to increase uptime and analyzed filament usage with optimizations to improve tracking and waste reduction
