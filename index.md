## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Sophomore at Cornell University majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Electrical Engineering. I'm passionate about all things aerospace and am currently the Composites Lead of Cornell Rocketry, a student-run project team focusing on building and launching a 10000 foot apogee hybrid rocket. Our rocket is entirely student designed and manufactured. I'm also really passionate about robotics, biking, and drumming, and you can find me in Lincoln Hall many times a week playing percussion! I've also had a wide variety of engineering experiences, and you can find more on my resume.
