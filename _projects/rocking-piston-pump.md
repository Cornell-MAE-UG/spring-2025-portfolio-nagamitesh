For MAE 3230 How Fluid Machines Work we dissected fluid mechanical devices in groups and created a detailed video showcasing our device and how it works. My group worked on dissecting a Jun-Air 2 Stage Rocking Piston Pump. Through dissecting this pump we explored its fluid mechanical make up and some calculations we did involved the airflow generated by the cooling fans running across the motor and the displacement and reynolds number of the flow generated by the pistons. We also found the methods by which air is transfered from high to low pressure through the smart use of reed valves and the pistons. We summarized our findings and explained how this pump works in the language of college-level fluid mechanics. I worked on the dissection of the pump, understanding how the pump worked, and visualizing flow across the pump.
