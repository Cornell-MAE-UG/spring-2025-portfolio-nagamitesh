For MAE 3260 System Dynamics, we did a project where we took apart an electric toothbrush and did an entire system dynamics analysis on the device. We created ODEs, Bode Plots, Matlab Scripts, State Space, and Parameter estimation for the tooth brush. I specifically worked on and created the state space model for the toothbrush based on the ODE. Our work can be found in the PDF below, and along with that the picture below is from our dissection. 

I was inspired by this old radio when I made this rendering:
